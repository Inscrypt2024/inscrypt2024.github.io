	<p><strong>Instructions for Authors</strong> </p>

	<p>
		Conference language is English. All submissions must be at most 18 pages excluding the references and clearly marked appendices (or auxiliary supporting material), 
		and using the Springer LNCS format (in particular, do not modify the LNCS default font sizes or margins). Details on the Springer LNCS format can be obtained via
		<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" target="_blank">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		All submissions will be blind-refereed and thus must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references (however, submissions may already be uploaded to preprint servers such as the IACR eprint or arXiv.org). 
		Submissions should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords, followed by an introduction, a main body, an appendix (if any), and references. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable for a non-expert reader. 
		Authors are advised to write their papers clearly and carefully, to provide good motivation for their work, and to give a high-level overview of the arguments and techniques used to obtain the main results. 
		Papers are likely to be rejected if the results are unable to be verified by the PC within the short review timeframe. Reviewers are not required to read beyond the 18 main pages, and the paper should be intelligible and self-contained within them.

		The paper must be submitted electronically to <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=inscrypt2024" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=inscrypt2024</a>.
		Proceedings including all accepted papers will be available at the conference, and the best papers will be selected for special issues.
